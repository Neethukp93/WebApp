# WebApp

#WebApp which has mainly three screens


HOME: 
Here is a list of all people who are not linked to companies, and have the opportunity to link them to one of the companies created in COMPANY screen.  

PERSON: 
Here the user can create a person. A person has a name and can be associated with a company (companies are created in COMPANY screen). 

COMPANY: 
Here the user can create a company. A company should only have "names" as attributes. Here the user should also be able to choose a company and then get all employees listed. In that listing, it should also be possible to remove an employee from the company. Then, the employee should no longer be associated with the company, but the person should remain in the system without any connection to any company (as if you created a person in PERSON screen without choosing a company).
